TurtlePlotBot
=============

The TurtlePlotBot is a MicroPython based 3D printed drawing robot inspired
by `MakersBox's <https://www.thingiverse.com/MakersBox>`_ `Arduino Chassis
for Drawing Robot <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1091401>`_. The
TurtlePlotBot can be easily built in a couple of hours and offers a fun
environment to learn python programming and robotics.

The software that runs the TurtlePlotBot is modular and includes the
`turtleplot` module. The `turtleplot` module contains the methods needed to
turn turtle graphics commands into simple robot movements. You can use the
`turtleplot` module run your own robot using different hardware without
having to write all the python code for each of the turtle graphics commands.

A TurtlePlotBot is built from 3D printed parts, a pair of 28BYJ-48
stepper motors and uses a MG90S mini servo to lift and lower a pen used for
drawing.

An ESP-32 Based Microcontroller module with a 240x135 LCD display
running MicroPython is paired with a `ESP32 DrawBot Board
<https://penfold.owt.com/turtleplotbot3/assembly-part2.html#drawbot-board>`_
to provide the interface circuitry needed to run the stepper motors, servo,
MicroSD card and a five way joystick. The TurtlePlotBot has Wifi capability
allowing it to be controlled and programmed wirelessly from a computer,
smartphone or tablet.

A menu system provides an easy way to configure the TurtlePlotBot, connect to
or create a Wifi access point as well as running TurtlePlotBot MicroPython
programs without the use of a computer or another device.
